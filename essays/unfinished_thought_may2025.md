# Created this notes as reminder for myself how things currently going.

So we have
- Internal Data team, at least in my team, struggling to create two important datamarts: MS Hiring and MH Ticket and Conversation
- We also have no new AI initiative whatsoever that already implemented. The chatting with documentation is expanded to Retail, but afar from that, nothing. There's an initiative that I want to do here.


My prediction for Data team in 31st December 2025 (if I'm still here)
- We already have every datamart that important to us and already have documentation for it. Even weird function like "Digital" should have their own, "Organic Click User" datamart or something.
- Either my initiative, XmRit + LLM is really succcesful (every meeting, the owner of the meeting need to consult with Jarvis Data AI) or it crash and burn. I truly have no idea where this is going, but bundling AI with XmR it might be a way to force this. Probably need to talk to Saurabh about this little experiment.
- Me will transition and become Principal + AI Analytics Engineer or something. Basically where all the data is there, the job for Data team is to build more and more experiment.

I'm writing this as 2025-05-21. Let's see
