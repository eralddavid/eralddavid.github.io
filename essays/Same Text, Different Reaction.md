Last December, I shared Steve Yegge's article, ["The Death of the Junior Developer,"](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer) with a close friend. I've long been an admirer of Yegge's work. I first encountered his famous ["Google's Platform Rant"](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) during my college years, marveling at both his audacity to speak so boldly and his evident expertise in the field.

IWhen sharing the article, I thought, "Here's an interesting perspective on AI from one of my favorite software experts—my friend would appreciate this.". I expected perhaps a casual thumbs-up emoji in response. Instead, a few days later, I received an unexpectedly urgent message:

"Oh my God, Rald! After reading (and 4x re-reading) that article, I immediately reached out to our university's Head of Study Program. We're scheduling an emergency meeting this Saturday to discuss its implications. I'll catch with you later to ask your opinion, but thanks for sharing this"

His reaction made me pause. I downloaded the article, printed it out, and decided to read it again more carefully. My friend rarely shows such alarm, which made me wonder what I might have missed in my initial reading. I re-read and questioned all the assumption.

We've met later that same month and share of our perspective. It was a lively debate, which too long to put in this short post. But we still had different reaction (and he's quite strong) even when we've spent >3 hours discussing about it.

Initially, I intended this commentary to be yet another perspective on AI, joining countless others shared across the internet. However, what fascinated me most wasn't the content itself, but how differently two people could interpret it. I had approached "The Death of the Junior Developer" with academic interest, curious about how the author would support his claims. But my friend's impression was like "Ohhh my God, all hell breaks loose" moment, require immediate action.

This experience reinforces a profound truth about the written word's impact on how we perceive and navigate our lives. Cognitive science tells us that the human brain functions as a prediction machine, constantly using available information for [sensemaking](https://commoncog.com/good-synthesis-adapting-to-uncertainty/). Yet, what struck me was how two people with remarkably similar backgrounds—both working in tech, graduates of the same university, with comparable years of experience—could derive such dramatically different meanings from the same text.
