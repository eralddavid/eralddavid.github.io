# Unfinished Thoughts

Or collection of phrases and passages that too good to forget, but still too raw to make an essay of.

### Bill Inmon, pioneer in Data Engineering, advice to somebody who's getting started in the field of data
> "I'm going to give them the same advice as if they were a bank robber: Go to where the money is. If you want to have long-term great success in our industry, find business value. Don't get hung up on > every technology that comes out, every new fangled thing that coms out. Go to where there's business value.

> Because at the end of the day, business value drives everything we do in technology."

### On the importance of knowing the data generation process first

One thing that I like to repeat to my team when we discussing things is "How's the data is generated?". It goes by different name in other division, most popular one is business process. But the principle is that anything that the company (Ops, Marketing, Product) and user doing will generates data. A lot of it. So understanding "What part of the process generate what kind of data" isn't only important but necessary. Nailed this very first part is important for the rest of step in the data's lifecycle. With good knowledge how's the data generated, we can build data modeling on top of it. By nailing the data modeling part, we can then build BI and modelling layer.

But try asking typical analytics person that you see in the wild and you might not find any of this insight in them.
