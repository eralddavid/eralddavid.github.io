# Unfinished Thoughts

Or collection of phrases and passages that too good to be forget, but still too raw to make an essay of.

### Bill Inmon, pioneer in Data Engineering, advice to somebody who's getting started in the field of data
> "I'm going to give them the same advice as if they were a bank robber: Go to where the money is. If you want to have long-term great success in our industry, find business value. Don't get hung up on > every technology that comes out, every new fangled thing that coms out. Go to where there's business value.

> Because at the end of the day, business value drives everything we do in technology."
