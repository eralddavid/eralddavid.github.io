# Almost All Things Around Us is A Form (and Other Things to Notes)

There's this fascinating video from PBS that I watched a while back. It's title is ["Why Do Things Keep Evolving Into Crabs?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw). The main message of the video is pretty interesting, if not amusing: crab shaped body, turns out, is the most flexible body shape for animal that increase their survival chance. So much so that almost animal adapted to it, creating a so called "fake crab" (animals with crab-y body). According to the video, crab shaped are "allowed crustaceans to go more places, do more things, and evade more predators", evolution automatically prefer it over other body shape, with its very natural creative destruction mechanism (means those animal who don't have crab shape, has a low chance to be wiped out). 

Okay, that's whole passage about crab in the essay that intended to talk about data structure and has "Form" in its title. So, what's up about it?

Like crab shape that "adopted" by many animals, I really feel that us data person still so, so not aware that all things around us can be identified as a form. Or at least, "form-like". If you're working in team who works around spreadsheet a lot, just see your opened Google Sheets or Excel, list down all the columns that exist there, and ask yourself "Is it that weird if I put this column as a question in, let's say, Google Form?". I bet almost all column is a "Huh, not that weird. In fact, I can see it". I can only think of one column that not in this category, which is those who need to call function (like SUM() or VLOOKUP() function).

I came to this realization because I was helping doing "Digital Transformation" (a.k.a eliminate all manual Google Sheets by properly productize its flow) in my company. When checking the manual sheet with my manager, we're all thinking the same thing: Wait, if we put these data into Google Form, it should make our life easier, right?"

And yes. Even team who create the manual sheet also agree when we ask the same question. Although, to be fair, there's no incentive structure for them to think "Wait, I need to make the schema of this sheet in a proper way". Their problem already hard enough to think about, and their go to response of creating another manual Google Sheet is to solve their problem quickly (and allow them to flexibly add something in the future).

And this is where, I think, a big problem that I still hasn't solved. Or at least don't have any actual practical solution to it. The tension between team who still use manual (prefer flexibility) and Data team that want all manual things gone ("just put it in the form") seems too high -- and I believe, at least right now, the "flexibility" part is winning. I consider myself has moderate skill in analytics and have good relationship with the team that creates these manual Google Sheet (so no political blocker whatsoever). It just the way it is.
