# Almost All Things Around Us is A Form (and Other Things to Notes)

There's this fascinating video from PBS that I watched a while back. It's title is ["Why Do Things Keep Evolving Into Crabs?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw). The main message of the video is pretty interesting, if not amusing: the crab-shaped body, it turns out, is the most flexible body shape for animals that increases their survival chance. So much so that many animals have adapted to become it, creating so-called "fake crabs" (animals with crab-like bodies). According to the video, crab shapes have "allowed crustaceans to go more places, do more things, and evade more predators." Nature had found the shape that worked and continously "promoting" it.

Okay, that's a whole passage about crabs in an essay that's intended to talk about data structure and has "Form" in its title. So, what's up with that?

### Every Sheet Around Me is Has a Form Like Structure

Like the crab shape that's been "adopted" by many animals through evolution, I've noticed that data structures in business settings follow a similar pattern. As a "data person," I've observed that almost everything around us naturally has a form structure, or at least something form-like. Anyone who works with spreadsheets regularly will recognize this pattern.

Here's how it typically unfolds: First, someone encounters a problem (a new business process that needs to be done) and creates a spreadsheet to solve it. Then, as time passes, the spreadsheet grows more complex - new columns appear, formulas multiply, and the structure gradually evolves. Finally, someone from the Data team, who's been tasked to "Get this data from this sheet," inevitably says, "This spreadsheet has become too unwieldy. We need to turn this into a proper form."

I discovered this pattern while working on "Digital Transformation" projects (that's corporate speak for "making messy processes less messy") that we currently do in the company. Every time we examined a complex, slow-running manual spreadsheet, we kept reaching the same conclusion: "This should have been a form from the start."

And to put this upfront, I love forms. Forms are actually brilliant tools for teaching non-technical people about data structure. Take Google Forms, for example. They gently force users to think about data types ("Okay, are you sure you want multiple options?") and validation rules ("This is a phone number question. Only put numbers in it, please") before collecting information. It's probably the most underrated tool for introducing people to structured data thinking.

That's why I initially thought that because forms are already a familiar tool for them, they would think to create forms first. But that doesn't happen. It rarely happens.

There's an ongoing tension between teams who prefer the flexibility of a manual, sheet-first approach and Data teams pushing for structured forms. Right now, flexibility seems to be winning this battle. I have to be honest - even as a data person, I sometimes prefer the freedom of a flexible spreadsheet over a rigid form. But having learned that everything is a form, I can now use it to guide my next action: either train the stakeholders to have "Form-first" mindset, or every person in Data team will, sooner or later, need to become mini Database Engineers who instantly migrate the data in the sheet to proper tools.

That's just how it is
