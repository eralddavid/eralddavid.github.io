# Almost All Things Around Us is A Form (and Other Things to Notes)

There's this fascinating video from PBS that I watched a while back. It's title is ["Why Do Things Keep Evolving Into Crabs?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw). The main message of the video is pretty interesting, if not amusing: the crab-shaped body, it turns out, is the most flexible body shape for animals that increases their survival chance. So much so that many animals have adapted to it, creating so-called "fake crabs" (animals with crab-like bodies). According to the video, crab shapes have "allowed crustaceans to go more places, do more things, and evade more predators." Evolution automatically prefers it over other body shapes, with its very natural creative destruction mechanism (meaning those animals who don't have a crab shape have a higher chance of being wiped out).

Okay, that's a whole passage about crabs in an essay that's intended to talk about data structure and has "Form" in its title. So, what's up with that?

### Every Sheet Around Me is Has a Form Like Structure

Like the crab shape that's been "adopted" by many animals, I really feel that we "Data people" are still so, so unaware that all things around us can be identified as a "form", or at least as "form-like." If you're working in a team that works with spreadsheets a lot, just look at your opened Google Sheets or Excel, list down all the columns that exist there, and ask yourself, "Is it that weird if I put this column as a question in, let's say, Google Form?" I bet almost 90% of your responses will be "Huh, not that weird. In fact, I can see it." I can only think of one type of column that doesn't fit this category: those that need to call functions (like SUM() or VLOOKUP() functions). And that's it.

I came to this realization because I was helping with "Digital Transformation" (a.k.a. eliminating all manual Google Sheets by properly productizing their flow) in my company. When checking few of these manual sheets with my manager, we were all thinking the same thing: "Wait, if we put these data into Google Form, it should make our life easier, right?"

And yes, even the team who created the manual sheet agreed when we asked the same question. Although, to be fair, there was no incentive structure for them to think, "Wait, I need to make the schema of this sheet in a proper way." Their problem was already hard enough to think about, and their go-to response of creating another manual Google Sheet was to solve their problem quickly (and allow them to flexibly add something in the future)

And this is where, I think, lies a big problem that I still haven't solved, or at least don't have any actual practical solution to. The tension between teams who still use manual processes (preferring flexibility) and the Data team that wants all manual things gone ("just put it in the form") seems too high -- and I believe, at least right now, the "flexibility" part is winning. I don't have any incentive to sugarcoat this. Even I prefer flexibility compared to tidy data structure. Just how the way it is.
