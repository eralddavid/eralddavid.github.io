# Almost All Things Around Us is A Form (and Other Things to Notes)

There's this fascinating video from PBS that I watched a while back. It's title is ["Why Do Things Keep Evolving Into Crabs?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw). The main message of the video is pretty interesting, if not amusing: the crab-shaped body, it turns out, is the most flexible body shape for animals that increases their survival chance. So much so that many animals have adapted to become it, creating so-called "fake crabs" (animals with crab-like bodies). According to the video, crab shapes have "allowed crustaceans to go more places, do more things, and evade more predators." Nature had found the shape that worked and continously "promoting" it.

Okay, that's a whole passage about crabs in an essay that's intended to talk about data structure and has "Form" in its title. So, what's up with that?

### Every Sheet Around Me is Has a Form Like Structure

Like the crab shape that's been "adopted" by many animals, I really feel that we "Data people" are still so, so unaware that all things around us can be identified as a "form". Or at least, like what the previous video said, "form-like". And for those of you who works in a team who use spreadsheet a lot, I know you will agree with me. 

The way this works is (1) someone has a problem, (2) they make a spreadsheet to solve it, (3) the spreadsheet gradually accumulates structure (new column here, and new formula there), and (4) eventually someone from other team (usually Data) will ask "Your sheet is too heavy, we can't operate with this. We need to form-alize this".

And to put it this upfront, I love form. It's most underrated way for non-technical people to grasp about "data structure". Simple Google Form, for example, force the user to at least think about the data type that they want to record. More advance, it can also 

I discovered this while doing "Digital Transformation" work, which is what companies call it when they want to make their messy processes less messy. Every time we looked at a manual spreadsheet who already really slows and coplex, the same thought occurred: "Oh my, we should've create form for this".

And this is where, I think, lies a big problem that I still haven't solved, or at least don't have any actual practical solution to. The tension between teams who still use manual processes (preferring flexibility) and the Data team that wants all manual things gone ("just put it in the form") seems too high -- and I believe, at least right now, the "flexibility" part is winning. I don't have any incentive to sugarcoat this. Even I prefer flexibility compared to tidy data structure. Just how the way it is.
