# About Me

Hi there! My name is Erald David Sibatuara. You can call me Erald.
Right now, I'm working at BukuWarung, a leading fintech company that focus on bringing more value to MSMEs in Indonesia!

If you find this blog (welcome!), it'll show as weird blog to you. This is a link blog -- something that I learn from Simon Willison's approach [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/). I'll post random stuff in this blog. Mostly commentary (I post the main article above and then put my thought on it), sometime even deeper. Do let me know if you find something is interesting.

For now, I want to hit my personal record of [publishing everyday from 7th Feb until 28th Feb](/essays/write_everyday_in_feb_2025).

If you want to reachout, you can check my Linkedin profile by name "Erald David Sibatuara". Happy to meet fellow traveler.
