# Erald David's Weblog

This is the link blog that I used to cite any article and post commentary on specific issue. Heavily inspired by [Simon Wilson's approach to link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/). 
Writing everyday is my goal this month (Feb 7th, 2024), however short that is. Let's see if I can do it consistently.
