# Erald David's Weblog

This is the link blog that I used to cite any article and post commentary on specific issue. Heavily inspired by [Simon Wilson's approach to link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/). 

My personal goal right now is to try [write everyday from 7th Feb until 28th Feb](/essays/write_everyday_in_feb_2025) this year. It's an ambitious goal for me -- I kept consuming article but rarely publish my own. This site will be a test.
